I am a` Machine Learning Engineer` and Researcher at Jordan University of Science and Technology, specializing in `Medical Image Engineering` and Processing within the Department of Allied Medical Sciences-Radiologic (Technology). My passion lies in the field of Machine Learning, 

which I enthusiastically write about on Medium. Beyond my technical endeavors, I am deeply intrigued by human behavior and `sociology`, constantly seeking to learn more about Human interactions and `Neuroscience`. 

In my downtime, I indulge in the soothing rhythms of Jazz and Blues music, reflecting my profound love for music. If not an engineer, I would have pursued a career in `psychology` to delve into the mysteries of the human mind. Join me on this journey as I explore the fascinating convergence of technology, `psychology`, and the essence of being human.
